## Projects
Academic and professional projects that I have been able to complete using analytics and hard skills.
### Project 1: Breast Cancer Prediction
- **Problem:** Construct models and predict whether an image of a FNA of a breast mass contains a benign or a malignant tumor
- **Solution:** Create different models to find predictors of breast cancer. The models I had to create were Decision trees, a Na√Øve Bayes models, Neural Network models, logistic regressions, and Forest models.
- **Challenges:** After creating all of these models accurately I had to compare all of these them to find which models had the best accuracy and the best AUC. I had to talk through and write about multiple Confusion Matrixs and what they meant for each test.
- Below is the image of all the models that I created for this project

### Proejct 2: Automate Server Decommission Process
- **Problem:** To decommission servers it took weeks to do it because of how many people were involved
- **Solution:** Utilize Ansible Automation to automate this process 
- **Challenges:** I had to learn how to use Ansible and how to incorporate that into the companies platforms. This was difficult because I had to learn everything from scratch and find out all the steps that I would need to automate it.
